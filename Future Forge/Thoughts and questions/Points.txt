Points:
1. It's in ideation stage.
2. It's a subsciption model.
3. The subscription model consists of three levels: a)Basic b)Advanced c)Curated
4. But for now, it's just a philanthropic work for scaling our platform.
5. The main goal of our idea is to provide a roadmap for not only well known career paths but also the niche ones.
6. Why do you need a funding now? Well, the main reason for us being here is to experience the environment,
   since we are a fresh ideation stage startup. TBH, we are here more for the guidance and less for the funding.
   Though we have a rough and raw sketch of our idea but we are still figuring out many things we can implement. 
7. We differ from other ed-techs by the usp for providing expertised curated roadmaps in niche fields and not faciliatating admissions in foreign universities.
